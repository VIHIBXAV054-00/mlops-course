"""The flow, its retry policy, and the record of which parameters built the model.

Two testing strategies, and the choice between them is measured rather than
assumed (numbers from this lab, prefect 3.8.2):

    task.fn(...)                      0.000s   — the undecorated function
    prefect_test_harness() setup      ~4.3s    — once, session-scoped
    a flow run inside the harness     ~1.1s    — each

So: `task.fn()` for anything that is really about the function's logic, and a
small number of real flow runs for the things that are about Prefect actually
doing something — retries actually retrying, state actually recorded.

A bare flow call with no harness also works, because Prefect starts a temporary
server; it costs ~8s of process startup. That is fine once and ruinous fifty
times, and it fails by being SLOW rather than by failing, which is the worst
shape for a time budget.
