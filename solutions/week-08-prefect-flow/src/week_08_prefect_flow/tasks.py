"""Prefect tasks: the pipeline's steps, with a retry policy that is mostly absent.

Read the `retries=` arguments in this file as a **map of where this pipeline
touches the network**, because that is exactly what they are. Three tasks have
them. Everything else has none, deliberately, and Exercise 3 is about why.

The rule, stated once:

    A retry is only useful when the SAME call, run again, might succeed. That
    means the failure has to be transient, and the operation has to be safe to
    repeat. Retrying anything else burns time and hides a real bug behind a
    delay.

`train` is deterministic and local. If it raised once it will raise three
times, and the only thing `retries=3` buys you is that the traceback you needed
arrives ninety seconds later.

    Exercise 3's second question, and the reason it is worth asking: every
    other retry in this file is free because the operation is content-addressed
    or read-only. This one creates a NEW MODEL VERSION on every call.

    So consider the failure that retries are for: the request reaches MLflow,
    MLflow commits the version, and the RESPONSE is lost. From here that is
    indistinguishable from "it never arrived" -- and the retry registers a
    second, identical version. Nothing errors. You simply have version 4 and
    version 5 pointing at the same run, and a registry that has quietly started
    lying about how many models you have.

    The mitigation here is the cheap one: ask first. Before registering, look
    for an existing version for this run id and return it if present. That
    narrows the window rather than closing it -- a true fix needs an
    idempotency key, which the MLflow registry does not offer.

    The general rule worth taking away:

        **Idempotency is a PRECONDITION for a retry, not a consequence of one.**
